# BioApps

**BioApps** are typical imaging workflows in the field of Life Science Research and similar or related fields. Typical steps involved are

* Image Acquisition with certain parameters on specific imaging systems
* Image Processing and Analysis
* Data Processing
* Visualization of the results

Typical example for such applications are:

* Cell Counting
* Scratch Assay
* Translocation Assay
* Live vs. Death Assay
* Proliferation Essay
* Confluence Measurements
* ...

This repository will contain some useful Image Analysis Settings, tools and scripts that can be used for various things "surrounding" those **BioApps**.

The Image Analysis Settings (*.czias) can be used inside ZEN Blue or ZEN Core with the example images. Depending on the real images those settings must be obviously modified.

Since the concept of **Open Application Development** (OAD) is about connecting the ZEN world with other valuable software tools, those example will also contain non-ZEN scripts etc.
